### FHE
**[Fully Homomorphic Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption)** is this hip new thing all the cool crypto kids are talking about.
It lets you operate on encrypted ciphertexts - so that anyone can compute the encrypted result of some function without ever knowing what the inputs really were (or even what the output really was). 

People are pretty excited about this because it promises some wild applications, like permissionless cloud computing or truly anonymous smart contracts.

### FHC
**Fully Homomorphic Computing** is something I just made up to describe a fully homomorphic *programming languages*. 
This is when the function that we homomorphically evaluate is the `eval` function itself. 
The input is encrypted code, and the output is the encrypted result of running that code.
But the computer itself never actually knows what it's executing!

Brainfreeze is a fully homomorphic computer for the [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) language. 
This means it takes encrypted Brainfuck programs as an input, runs them, and returns their encrypted output, without learning anything from the entire process.
It's built on the [TFHE](https://tfhe.github.io/tfhe/) library, and to the best of my knowledge, it's is the first actual implementation of fully homomorphic computing.

This is probably because FHE is excruciatingly slow: with TFHE, each boolean operation on two encrypted bits takes 10-20 milliseconds to evaluate. 
With an 8-bit architecture and 16 bytes of RAM, Brainfreeze sputters along at around 0.1 hertz (1 cycle every 10 seconds) on a 2017 Macbook Pro. ðŸ˜¬

The bytes of RAM affect speed because the data pointer is encrypted along with every other register. 
Since we never actually know where the data pointer is, or which instruction we're executing, Brainfreeze has to execute every possible operation on every possible memory address on every clock cycle, and pretend to update each one.
This is a general problem with FHE: every branch in your control flow has to be explored and recombined at the end.
There's no way around it without leaking information about your inputs; we must surrender to the Tyranny of Exponential Loop Unrolling.

### Brainfreeze

Brainfreeze is a stack of three abstraction layers:

1. A Python wrapper for the TFHE library. This is `tfhe.py` and `tfhe_utils.py`. They're written using `ctypes` and is probably the most useful part of this whole rigmarole.
2. A collection of homomorphic circuits (adders, muxes, RAM, CPU) built from TFHE gates. They inherit from the `Circuit` class in `circuits.py`.
3. A minimal Brainfuck computer similar in design to [this one](https://github.com/briandef/bf16). The interface in `brainfreeze.py` exposes `compile`, `evaluate`, and `decompile` functions to interact with it concisely.

## API

First, [install TFHE](https://tfhe.github.io/tfhe/installation.html).

Then clone this repo and compile the Python wrapper. [1]
```shell
git clone https://github.com/joeltg/brainfreeze
cd brainfreeze
make
```

[1] This `tfhe_io.c` wrapper is actually *just* for I/O. The TFHE functions to read and write ciphertexts and gate parameters to and from files takes `FILE*` objects, which I can't figure out how to use with `ctpyes`. So `tfhe_io.c` has wrapper functions that take file descriptors as integers. If anyone has a real solution to this, please tell me.
